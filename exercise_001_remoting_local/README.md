`context.actorSelection` isn't supported on Akka Typed, from now on this will be done with 
the recepctionists.

Here we'll do two things create a Main to check that we know how to connect to another 
system
=       actor provider
        transport protocol
        hostname and port

after that we can connect to local, remote or cluster ()
